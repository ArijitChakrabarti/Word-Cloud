Word clouds are a fascinating way to explore insights behind text.  Oftentimes text does not lend itself to the same manner of representation as one can do with numeric data.

Word clouds are not something new.  Stanley Milgram is credited with its invention through the representation of a a research to study the recall of key landmarks in Paris.  The landmarks which had a higher recall would be represented by proportionately bigger lettering as compared to landmarks which did not have much recall.  All this was done on a cloudish visualisation.

Cut to 2008 to 2011 where tag clouds gained prominence Flickr (the photo sharing website).  However tag clouds have declined over time and has been replaced by the growing popularity of word clouds.

A quick check on google trends shows the following:

 The best part is actually its implementation in python.  There was no need to pip install any additional packages, just check if wordcloud library is already installed- which it should be; and the code itself is just a couple of lines.
The inspiration for this is from an article published on [analyticsvidhya.com on 'How to build a word cloud in Python?'](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/05/how-to-build-word-cloud-in-python/)
